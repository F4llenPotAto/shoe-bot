# shoe-bot

## Our first attempt at a python chat bot.

shoe-bot is:

  * **Experimental**:
  Do NOT give us your credit card info! John Wick will not save you...

  * **Fast on all platforms**:
  WIP -- Migrate libraries over to another language?
  
  * **A POC**:
  This is our first introduction into http requests and web scraping.

shoe-bot's primary use as a CLI will allow you to buy XYZ product.

## What we want to do first to build a POC

1. Identify ideal tool to interact with Nike website
	1. Selenium (Python)
	2. Puppeteer (Javascript)
	3. hot-keys?
2. Build hello-world with Selenium/Puppeteer
3. Build working example with safe website
4. Build POC for non-critical NIKE product (Ex: sandals)
